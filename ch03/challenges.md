# Challenges

1. Write some sample Lox programs and run them (you can use the implementations of Lox in my repository). Try to come up with edge case behavior I didn’t specify here. Does it do what you expect? Why or why not?

2. This informal introduction leaves a lot unspecified. List several open questions you have about the language’s syntax and semantics. What do you think the answers should be?

I'm kinda curious if other structures (arrays, dictionaries/hashes) are built in aside from the existing object/class type.

I'm also not sure how parameter requirements work. What happens if you don't specifiy a parameter when calling a function?

3. Lox is a pretty tiny language. What features do you think it is missing that would make it annoying to use for real programs? (Aside from the standard library, of course.)

Being able to load in another file! Makes it pretty impossible to share code other than copy/paste.
